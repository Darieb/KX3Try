# KX3Try

This is a toy program that can read Elecraft radio memories (KX3, surely K3, and KX2. Maybe even K4, eventually.)
I use it to experiment with data formatting and discovery.

It was working 2025 May to read the standard and band-specific memories.
Experimenting now with Band and XVTR settings, and possibly radio settings.
